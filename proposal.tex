\begin{abstract}

\TheProject will develop a control methodology within nonequilibrium statistical
thermodynamics, promoting irreversible thermodynamics and dynamical systems to a unified tool for
industrial
applications which includes the recent progress in fluctuation and response
theory.
New technologies will benefit from the manipulations of and the control via macroscopic
nonequilibria. These are nonlinear systems that are are subject to nonconservative forces or
driven from contacts with multiple reservoirs that impose conflicting thermodynamic
behavior, or for which the constituents are active, {\it i.e.}, objects that could be
self-propelling. Our main hypothesis is that macroscopic nonequilibria can be used for
steering immersed subsystems or probes, thus developing a control theory using nonequilibria
together with the possibility of creating new macroscopic phases.
%
The expected deliverables include enhanced stabilization of metastable phases and the
emergence of new response and transport behavior, crucial items in developing systematically
interesting devices and material properties.
For technological avenues, our work will reveal important insights, experimental and
computational methods for example by providing far-from-equilibrium relaxation times of
viscoelastic media, for targeted catalysis, for clustering control or for viscosity
reduction in industrial processing. Other possible applications involve noninvasive
surgeries and drug delivery in medicine, or the design of smart materials with built-in
actuation mechanisms.
%
Previous efforts focused on the destructive and information-erasure roles of dissipation.
Time has come to comprehend and exploit the
constructive role and possibilities of nonequilibrium conditions. Complementary to entropy
production, changes in kinetics and dynamical activity make statistical forces nongradient
and nonadditive, allowing unseen and novel behavior. Controlling it opens a new paradigm and major
opportunities for future technology.

\section{Ethics and Security}

\eucommentary{This section is not covered by the page limit.}

\subsection{Ethics}

\eucommentary{
If you have entered any ethics issues in the ethical issue table in the administrative proposal forms, you must:\\
$\bullet$ submit an ethics self-assessment, which: \\
-- describes how the proposal meets the national legal and ethical requirements of the
country or countries where the tasks raising ethical issues are to be carried out;\\
-- explains in detail how you intend to address the issues in the ethical issues table, in
particular as regards:
research objectives (e.g. study of vulnerable populations, dual use, etc.),
research methodology (e.g. clinical trials, involvement of children and related
consent procedures, protection of any data collected, etc.),
the potential impact of the research (e.g. dual use issues, environmental damage,
stigmatisation of particular social groups, political or financial retaliation,
benefit-sharing, malevolent use , etc.)\\
$\bullet$ provide the documents that you need under national law (if you already have them), e.g.:\\
-- an ethics committee opinion;\\
-- the document notifying activities raising ethical issues or authorizing such activities\\
If these documents are not in English, you must also submit an English summary of them
(containing, if available, the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned).\\
If you plan to request these documents specifically for the project
you are proposing, your request must contain an explicit reference to the project title}

\subsection{Security}

Please indicate if your proposal will involve:

\begin{compactitem}
\item activities or results raising security issues: NO
\item 'EU-classified information' as background or results: NO
\end{compactitem}
\end{proposal}
