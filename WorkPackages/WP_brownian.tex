\mdescription
%
Whether one is interested in industrial (oil, polymer melts, dense colloidal or micellar
suspensions) or biomedical (blood, mucus, DNA-solutions) systems, control and diagnosis
tools have yet to consider consistently the visco-elastic environment.
%
In a viscoelastic fluid, one finds a combination of elastic behavior (like a solid) and
viscous behavior (like a fluid).
%
As a consequence, such fluids exhibit large relaxation times (up to seconds), and can be
easily driven out of thermal equilibrium by a forced colloidal probe.
%
In this WP, we study how the local perturbation of visco-elastic systems affects the
dynamics and effective interactions of colloidal particles with a particular view on memory
effects, many body interactions and local non-linear rheological properties. Such studies
will in general reveal the properties of nonequilibrium baths which are of manifold
importance.
%
We test rigorously the concepts of nonequilibrium thermodynamics (as outlined in the
main description) and design control and exploitation tools for processes where such
nonlinear fluids are used.

{\bf Specifically, in experiments} we study the dynamical behavior of {\bf externally driven} colloidal particles in different types of visco-elastic
fluids, e.g. micellar or polymer solutions. External forces will be created by optical, magnetic and gravitational forces where considerable expertise is present in the Stuttgart group. In addition to single driven particles, also complex, dynamical forces can be created by acousto-optical deflectors where controlled driving forces can be applied up to several hundred particles.
%
We also generate well-defined global flow fields in microfluidic devices \cite{scholz2012}
to control the visco-elastic properties of the liquid.

Furthermore, we also study the motion of {\bf self-propelled particles} in visco-elastic media. This is achieved by a light-induced local demixing process which has been recently demonstrated by the Stuttgart group \cite{kuemmel2013, buttinoni2013, tenHagen2014} and which can be extended to visco-elastic systems. In contrast to externally driven particles, the force-field of self-propelled particles are fundamentally different. Accordingly, qualitative changes in the response of the visco-elastic liquids to self-propelled particles are expected. The comparision of the liquid's response to externally and self-driven particles will provide a more complete characterization of the
nonequilibrium fluctuations of a visco-elastic bath. One important aspect of this system is that the
probe, being on the micron scale (hence sensitive to fluctuations), is still large compared
to the constituents of the bath (sizes below $\sim 100$~nm), so that the desired {\it
  continuum description} of the bath can be expected to prove useful.

{\bf On the theoretical side}, we derive effective (continuum) descriptions for the
modeling of probes in visco-elastic fluids far from equilibrium. We proceed via
integration of the bath degrees of freedom (using the Zwanzig-Mori projection formalism and
density functional theory).
%
The theoretical group in Stuttgart is very experienced in such coarse graining procedures
\cite{Aerov14} including far-from-equilibrium physics \cite{Kruger11,Kruger09}.
