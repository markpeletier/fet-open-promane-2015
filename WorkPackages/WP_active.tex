  \item Derive from microscopic many-particle models and check numerically and experimentally 
  \textbf{nonequilibrium equations of state (NEOS)} for  \textbf{active Brownian particle suspensions}.
  \item Characterize fluctuations and response of polymeric probes affected by \textbf{active
    crowding}, e.g. biopolymers excited by molecular motors in the cytoplasm of animal cells.
  \item Validate in experiment and simulation the concept of a frequency-dependent \textbf{noise temperature} 
  in fluctuation-dissipation relations for colloidal probes.

\mdescription
%
Far from equilibrium, fluctuations are non-universal and standard thermodynamic notions,
such as temperature and pressure, become ambiguous. 
This has many unintuitive practical consequences, which defy conventional thermodynamic
wisdom and potentially invalidate standard technological procedures.
%
For example, a colloidal particle in a non-isothermal solvent cannot be used for Brownian thermometry 
in the conventional way \cite{rings-etal:2010,kroy:2014}. In theory, we have shown how to overcome this problem
in terms of a frequency-dependent noise temperature \cite{falasco-etal:2014}.
%
We will validate these ideas experimentally and extend them for other
nonequilibria, e.g. in active-particle suspensions.
%
Similarly, the mechanical pressure on a mesoscopic probe will depend on the range and symmetry 
of the medium-probe interactions \cite{solon-etal:2015}. We will elucidate how. 
%
In the context of living cells, motile proteins and molecular motors affect the function
of its constituents by what  we call ``active crowding'', in analogy with the much studied ``molecular crowding''.
%
Can the effect of active crowding (like molecular crowding \cite{schoebl-etal:2014}) on the conformational motion 
of embedded biopolymers be captured by a parameter renormalization?

\begin{task}[title=Nonequilibrium equations of state (NEOS),id=task1,lead=ULEI,partners={UNIPD,USTUTT},
wphases={0-40!0.5,24-30,36-38}]
Design and characterize a model for active-particle suspensions, together with the group
in Padova (exchange of personel) that will provide essential expert knowledge on
nonequilibrium response theory.
%
We start with a many-body Langevin equation, with individual propulsion forces for the
active particles \cite{solon-etal:2015}, and compute for colloidal probes the effective
friction kernels, induced mutual interactions and non-gradient forces.
%
Nonequilibrium response theory (as theoretically developed in the Leuven-Padova nodes) lets us include 
frenetic contributions in the response functions \cite{baiesi-wynants:2009} and in the mechanical pressure 
exerted by an active fluid on a probe. 
%
Geometric symmetries (tacitly) imposed in previous approaches will be relaxed and realistic particle-probe interactions, 
as appropriate for the hot Janus particles studied in our experiments and simulations, will be introduced.
%
To clarify how active-particle suspensions are fundamentally different from externally driven systems,
we will compare our particle-based approach to the field theoretical approach pursued in Stuttgart (exchange of personel). 

\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Active Crowding,id=task2,lead=ULEI,partners={KUL},wphases=0-40!0.5]
We investigate by analytical theory three different schematic types of active crowding 
that affect the fluctuation spectrum and dynamics of a semiflexible test polymer \cite{otto-etal:2013}: 
power strokes of molecular motors inducing backbone tension spikes,
``inelastic'' \cite{gralka-kroy:2015}unbinding of weak (cytoskeletal) bonds under 
arbitrarily fast dynamic loading \cite{bullerjahn-sturm-kroy:2014}, and an attached laser-heated metal nanoparticle tracer.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Noise Temperature,id=task3,lead=ULEI,wphases=0-32!0.5]
We test recent predictions for non-isothermal Brownian motion \cite{rings-etal:2010,falasco-etal:2014}  
beyond the Markov limit. Our massively parallel numerical simulations \cite{chakraborty-etal:2011} 
employ (highly compressible) Lennard--Jones solvents, to which we will adapt the theory.
Experimentally, this requires to follow the fluctuations of 
a heated Brownian particle on a nanosecond timescale and picometer spatial resolution, which has
\emph{even in equilibrium} only recently become possible  \cite{kheifets-etal:2014}.
%
A dedicated optical trap with dual beam heating and a detection bandwidth of about 50 MHz
will therefore be newly constructed. 
%
The classical method of Brownian thermometry will hereby be extended to media far from equilibrium.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Active Brownian Particle Suspensions,id=task4,lead=ULEI,wphases=16-48!0.5]
Technological applications of active-particle suspensions  are
currently severely hampered by a lack of control over these systems.
%
We have recently established innovative force-free control systems, so-called photon nudging
and thermophoretic trapping technologies \cite{Qian2013,Braun:NanoLetters:2015}, which deliberately exploit 
the nonequilibrium transport caused by non-isothermal conditions.
%
Using them in our experiments with hot Janus particles, and accompanying "all-atom" molecular-dynamics 
simulations \cite{chakraborty-etal:2011}, will allow for a continuous tuning of the strength of 
the activity and confinement to target failures of thermodynamic bulk-pressure equations of
state \cite{ginot-etal:2015}.
