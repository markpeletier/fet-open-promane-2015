\item
a table showing number of person/months required (table 3.4a)
\item
a table showing 'other direct costs' (table 3.4b) for participants where
those costs exceed 15\% of the personnel costs (according to the budget
table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms)
\end{compactitem}}

\eucommentary{Please indicate the number of person/months over the whole
duration of the planned work, for each work package, for each participant.
Identify the work-package leader for each WP by showing the relevant
person-month figure in bold.}

The personnel resources are summarized in table~\ref{fig:staffeffort}.

For \site{KUL}, \site{TUE} and \site{UNIPD} the effort is theoretical while for \site{ULEI}
and \site{USTUTT} there is a strong experimental effort.

\wpfig[label=fig:staffeffort,caption=Summary of Staff Efforts.]

The ``other direct costs'' in excess of 15\% of the ``personnel direct cost'', displayed in
table~\ref{fig:otherdirect}, are related to experimental material for \site{ULEI} and
\site{USTUTT} and to the comparatively reasonable cost of work in Italy for \site{UNIPD},
where the actual amount is similar to that of the other partners.
